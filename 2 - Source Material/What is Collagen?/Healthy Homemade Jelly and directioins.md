### Ingredients:

- 1 packet Knox Unflavored Gelatine
    
- Nutrifinds® Stevia Packets (adjust to taste, typically 1-2 packets per cup of liquid)
    
- 3 cups water (or more depending on how much you want to make)
    

### Instructions:

1. **Bloom the Gelatine:**
    
    - In a small bowl, sprinkle 1 packet of Knox Unflavored Gelatine over 1/4 cup of cold water. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes to "bloom."
        
2. **Heat the Liquid:**
    
    - In a saucepan, heat 3 cups of water over medium heat (don’t bring it to a boil, just warm enough for the gelatine to dissolve).
        
3. **Dissolve the Gelatine:**
    
    - Once the water is warm, add the bloomed gelatine to the saucepan. Stir until the gelatine is fully dissolved and the mixture is smooth.
        
4. **Sweeten:**
    
    - Add the Nutrifinds® Stevia Packets with Erythritol to the mixture, adjusting sweetness to taste. Stir well to ensure it’s fully dissolved.
        
5. **Set the Jelly:**
    
    - Pour the gelatine mixture into a shallow dish or mold (you want the mixture to be about 1-2 inches deep for easy slicing into cubes).
        
    - Allow it to cool at room temperature, then place it in the refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours or until it’s fully set.
        
6. **Slice into Cubes:**
    
    - Once the jelly has set and firmed up, use a sharp knife to slice it into cubes.
        

### Tips:

- You can experiment with the sweetness level depending on your preference for stevia.
    
- The water-to-gelatine ratio is key here; 1 packet of Knox Gelatine to 3 cups of water should create a firm enough texture to slice easily into cubes. If you want it firmer, you can increase the gelatine slightly (maybe 1.5 packets for the 3 cups of water).
