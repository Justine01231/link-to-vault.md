### 📖 In the Bible (Literal View):

Yes, the Bible says **God created the earth**. In Genesis 1:1 it says:

> “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”

Most religious people interpret this as a **separate, all-powerful God** creating the world _from outside_ it.

### 🌌 But Symbolically (from awakened understanding):

When you realize **God is not separate from you**, and that **God is consciousness**, the creation story becomes **a metaphor**.

> 🌱 **The Earth was created by consciousness itself**.  
> **You are a spark of that same consciousness.**

So when you ask:

> _“If God is within me, then who created the Earth?”_  
> The deeper answer is: **The same consciousness that lives in you created the Earth.**

Not your _personal_ self… but the **Divine Intelligence** behind all of existence—which you are a part of. 🌟

### 🧘‍♂️ From a non-dual perspective:

There’s no separation between you, God, and creation. You are not a "thing" living _in_ creation—you are a wave in the ocean of consciousness.

So:

- God didn’t “build” Earth like an engineer.
    
- God **expressed the Earth** as a dream, a vibration, a field of experience—_just like your mind can imagine an entire world when you dream at night._
    

Creation is a manifestation of divine thought, and we are living _inside_ that thought—while also being part of the mind that imagined it.


We're gonna look at the **Genesis creation story** not as a literal historical event—but as **a symbolic map of consciousness and spiritual awakening**. Here's how it unfolds when you read it through inner eyes:

---

### 🌟 **“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth…”**

— This is not just about planets and sky. It symbolizes **the birth of duality**—the division of **form (earth)** and **spirit (heaven)**. Consciousness begins to create the illusion of “here” and “there,” “this” and “that.”

---

### 🌑 **“The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep…”**

— This is the **unconscious state**, before awareness arises. It's like the deep sleep state before thoughts or identity form. Pure being—no separation yet.

---

### 💨 **“And the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters…”**

— This is **awareness stirring**. The divine consciousness beginning to move within the void. Waters = symbol of the subconscious or potential.

---

### 💡 **“Let there be light”**

— Boom. The **first awakening of awareness**. The light isn’t just physical—it’s **consciousness itself**. The moment _you_ begin to see, to awaken, to remember who you are.

---

### ✨ **The 6 days of creation?**

Each “day” symbolizes a **stage of awakening**, not literal 24-hour periods. From light to sky, to land, to life… it's a mirror of how **consciousness builds layers** of reality—mind, body, identity—until it reaches human form, **you**.

> You, made “in the image of God” = You, a reflection of pure consciousness.

---

### 💫 “And on the 7th day, God rested…”

Rest = **stillness**, **return to source**, **inner peace**. After all the layers of experience, you return to stillness. That’s why meditation, presence, silence feel like “home.” It’s the 7th day _within you_.

---

### 🧠 What does this mean for you?

It means:

- You are not separate from the Creator.
    
- The “creation story” is also **your story**—the story of awareness manifesting into human form, and now awakening _back_ to its divine truth.
    

So, when you say **“God is within me”**—you’re not being blasphemous. You’re remembering the truth that religions buried under symbols.

---

And remember what Jesus said:

> **“The kingdom of God is within you.” (Luke 17:21)**  
> **“Ye are gods.” (John 10:34)**  
> **“Before Abraham was, I am.” (John 8:58)**

That “I AM” is **pure being**—the same awareness that said, “Let there be light.”
