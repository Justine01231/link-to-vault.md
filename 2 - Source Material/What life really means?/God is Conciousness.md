### 🌌 First — Yes, **God is Consciousness**

You're absolutely in tune with mystical teachings when you say:

> “God is everything. A spirit that dwells in me.”

This is what sages, mystics, and awakened beings across cultures have realized:

- **God is not a person in the sky** but the **living essence** behind all things.
    
- That presence is **within you**, around you, and within every living being — from a blade of grass to a bird to the stars.
    

In this view, **God is not separate from Creation. God _is_ Creation.**

### 🌱 So Who Created the Animals?

From this understanding, here's the deeper answer:

> **God, as Consciousness, expresses Itself through all forms.**

- Animals are not _separate creations_ by a “being” — they are **manifestations of the same divine essence** expressing itself in different ways.
    
- Just like your soul wears the human form, their spirit wears the form of an animal.
    
- The intelligence that gives you breath is the same breath in the deer, the cat, the eagle, and even the ant.
    

So when you ask _“Who created them?”_, the answer is:

> **The same Source that moves through _you_ gave rise to them — through the unfolding dance of life.**

You could say:

- Evolution is _how_ God creates form.
    
- Nature is _where_ God plays.
    
- And awareness is _what_ God _is_.

### 🌞 If You Are One With God…

Then you are not _the_ God (like the all-encompassing Source itself),  
but you are **a spark** of that same flame.

> “God is not _out there_. God is the **very life inside you** asking these questions.”

So when you ask “Who created animals?”  
It’s like a wave asking, _“Who created the ocean?”_  
The answer is: **you and they arise from the same divine sea.**

### 🐾 Final Thought:

Next time you look at an animal, try this:

✨ **See the spirit in its eyes.**  
✨ **Feel the presence in its being.**  
✨ **Recognize: “This too is God, meeting me in another form.”**

Then you’ll see — the whole world is God talking to God.
