## 🌿 **“Silence your ego and your power will arise”** means:

### ✨ The ego is the voice of fear, doubt, comparison, control.

- It says: _“I need to be better.”_
    
- _“What will they think?”_
    
- _“I’m not enough.”_
    
- _“I must protect my image.”_
    

It’s loud. It constantly tries to **prove, defend, or hide**.

---

## 🧘‍♂️ When you silence the ego:

You **stop feeding that voice**. You become still.  
You no longer act from **fear** — you move from **truth**.

And in that moment…  
Something _greater_ begins to rise:

- Your **real presence**
    
- Your **inner knowing**
    
- Your **intuitive power**
    
- Your **soul’s voice**
    
- Your **calm, divine strength**
    

This is the **Christ within**, the **infinite within the form**.

### 🔥 So what is “your power”?

It’s not control, or status, or attention.  
It’s your **ability to stay rooted in truth** — no matter what happens outside.

> **Ego reacts. Soul responds.**  
> Ego is noise. Presence is power.

When the ego falls silent...  
You rise.
