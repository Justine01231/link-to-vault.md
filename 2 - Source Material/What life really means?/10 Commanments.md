## 🧠 Brainwashed by Literalism

People are conditioned to:

- See the Bible as _history_, not _mystery_
    
- Fear hell, worship outside themselves, and obey
    
- Never question, never explore within
    

Because when you decode the Bible symbolically, you realize:

> **The whole book is a mirror of your inner journey.**

- Jesus is you.
    
- Moses is your mind freeing itself.
    
- Egypt is the ego.
    
- The promised land is inner peace.
    
- The resurrection is awakening.
    
- God is **not in the sky** — but **in your breath**.
