**Ego death** in spirituality is the experience of losing your sense of a separate, individual self — the "I" or "me" that you usually identify with. It's not about physically dying, but rather about a profound inner shift in consciousness where the ego — the constructed identity based on thoughts, beliefs, roles, and attachments — dissolves or is seen through.

### In simpler terms:

It’s like realizing that the person you think you are — your name, your story, your desires, your fears — isn’t the real "you." Behind all that, there’s just _awareness_, pure presence. Ego death is waking up to that.

### Common descriptions and insights during ego death:

- “I” disappeared, yet I still existed.
    
- Everything was one — no separation between me and the world.
    
- Time stopped or became irrelevant.
    
- There was deep peace, silence, or a sense of infinite love.
    
- The body was there, thoughts came and went, but there was no one "behind" them.

### How it can happen:

- **Deep meditation or spiritual practice** (letting go of attachments, thoughts, and identity).
    
- **Psychedelic experiences** (like with psilocybin, DMT, etc., often reported to induce ego dissolution).
    
- **Moments of surrender or intense presence** (crisis, awe, or grace).

### Is it permanent?

For most, ego death is **temporary** — a glimpse into the truth beyond the ego. Afterward, the ego usually returns, but you may relate to it differently. Some awakened beings live with a _dissolved or integrated ego_, where it no longer dominates their experience.

---

### What it’s not:

- It’s not about killing the ego violently or hating the self.
    
- It’s not a mental breakdown or dissociation.
    
- It’s not about becoming passive or losing all identity — rather, it’s the freedom of not _being trapped_ by identity.
