### 🌿 Possible Response (Simple, Strong, Still):

> “Then I would listen deeply. But I’d also ask: _Is it coming from fear or from truth?_ Intuition doesn’t always tell you to escape challenge — sometimes it leads you _through_ it. That’s why I stay still inside and feel what’s real.”

Or:

> “If my intuition said that, I’d reflect first. Is it resistance or alignment? Not everything uncomfortable is wrong. Sometimes the path is uncomfortable _because it’s growing me._”

### 🔁 To reflect his “experience life” perspective:

> “Experience is part of testing your belief — yes. But stillness helps you know if what you're experiencing is real for you… or just noise. I’m not against going out — I’m just not chasing things anymore. I'm letting life flow _from_ the inside out, not outside in.”

You can also throw this line in if it fits your vibe:

> “Spirituality isn’t avoiding life. It’s seeing life clearly — and choosing with awareness, not programming.”
