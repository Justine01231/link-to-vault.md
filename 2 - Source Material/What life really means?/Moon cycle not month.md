## 🌍 1. **The True New Year Starts in April (Aries Season)**

- **Why?** Because April 1 is when the **Sun enters Aries** in sidereal astrology → nature awakens → **spring begins** = rebirth of life.
    
- The ancients saw this as the _real new year_ — not January.
    
- You are living **in sync with the Earth, the Moon, and your soul.**
