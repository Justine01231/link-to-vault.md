### üåô **2. Lucid Dreaming (Lucid Traveling)**

**What it is:**  
A dream where you **become aware** that you are dreaming _while_ still in the dream. Once lucid, you can often control the dream environment or explore freely.

**Key traits:**

- Occurs during REM sleep (a dream state).
    
- You realize _‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm dreaming!‚Äù_ but you stay in the dream body.
    
- The environment is often more dream-like or symbolic than astral projection.
    
- You can shape the dream world, fly, ask questions, meet parts of your subconscious.
    

**Feels like:**  
Being in a movie or video game that you suddenly realize you're creating in real-time.
