My first dream that I remember:

Because I’m into calisthenics, I saw one of my friends asking another friend to do a handstand. She didn’t know how to do it well, but she did some warm-up exercises, practiced kicking up, and eventually held a handstand. The friend who was asking could already do a handstand.

After that, I was doing yoga, and my friend was shocked at how flexible I was. She was even more shocked when she saw how my leg moved — it looked like it became hyperflexible or even broken while I was holding my core and lifting my leg high up.

Then the dream shifted: my relatives were in our town, getting ready to return to their country. But they were waiting for one person. If that person came, their departure would be delayed. Everything seemed to hinge on that one arrival.
