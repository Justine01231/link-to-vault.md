**The Forbidden Message: You Are Divine**

---


## 🥁 PART 1: PROGRAMMING THE MIND

> "Your mind has been programmed from the beginning."

You are born into a world that immediately begins shaping your beliefs:

- Religion teaches fear of God, sin, and separation
    
- Society defines your worth by money, success, and status
    
- Parents pass on their own unhealed trauma
    
- School and government train obedience, not awareness
    

Your subconscious becomes the storage place of fear, shame, and limitation.

You start to believe:

> "I am broken. I need saving. I must obey."

But this is the illusion.

---

## 🪜 PART 2: YOU WERE BORN FREE

You came into this world:

- Innocent
    
- Connected to Source
    
- Divine in nature
    

But you were told:

- You are a sinner
    
- You must fear God
    
- You must earn love and approval
    

> "You were born in heaven, but taught you were in hell."

---

## ⛪ PART 3: THE CHURCH STORY

A man hears a preacher shout:

> "Anyone who believes they are God is demonic!"

Yet the Bible says:

- "You are gods." (Psalm 82:6)
    
- "The Kingdom of God is within you." (Luke 17:21)
    

> The church says God is outside of you. But scripture says God is within.

This contradiction exposes the control.

---

## 🤠 PART 4: THE LOOP OF FEAR

You are kept in a cycle:

1. Feel shame
    
2. Beg forgiveness
    
3. Seek approval
    
4. Repeat
    

The system never teaches healing. It teaches obedience.

Because:

> "An awakened person cannot be controlled."

## ✨ PART 5: SYMBOLISM OF THE BIBLE

- Jesus at 33 = The Christ oil rising up the 33 vertebrae
    
- Upper Room = Your brain/pineal gland (seat of God consciousness)
    
- 12 Disciples = 12 cranial nerves / 12 zodiac signs
    
- Garden of Eden = Your mind
    
- The Snake = Wisdom, kundalini energy
    

> Jesus didn’t die for sin. He showed us how to die to the ego and awaken.

---

## 📂 PART 6: THE SUBCONSCIOUS IS THE KEY

> "If you don’t deal with your pain, your pain becomes your personality."

Your subconscious:

- Runs 95% of your life
    
- Stores trauma, beliefs, fear
    
- Can be reprogrammed through meditation and presence
    

> Meditation is not demonic. It’s the doorway to God.

---

## ⚡ PART 7: WHAT IS SIN?

Sin = Separation from your divine nature

- It is _not_ actions
    
- It is _forgetting who you are_
    
- It is _living from ego, fear, illusion_
    

> Sin is not what you do. Sin is what you forget.

---

## 🌟 FINAL MESSAGE: WAKE UP

You were never meant to live in fear. You are not a servant. You are the divine itself.

> "Go within. That’s where the real Kingdom is."
