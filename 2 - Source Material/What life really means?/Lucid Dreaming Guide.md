### 🔑 **1. Build Dream Recall First**

If you don’t remember your dreams, you won’t realize when you're in one.

**What to do:**

- Keep a **dream journal** by your bed.
    
- Write _everything_ you remember the moment you wake up—even fragments.
    
- Set the intention each night:
    
    > _“I will remember my dreams.”_
    

✨ This tunes your mind to value dreams. The more you recall, the more lucid you become.

---

### 🧠 **2. Perform Reality Checks**

The goal is to question reality so much during the day that it becomes a habit _in your dreams too._

**Common checks:**

- **Look at your hands** – In dreams they often look weird or distorted.
    
- **Pinch your nose and try to breathe through it** – In dreams, you still can.
    
- **Look at text or a clock, look away, then back** – It usually changes in dreams.
    

✨ Say while checking:

> _“Am I dreaming?”_  
> If you do this enough during the day, you'll do it in your dreams—and **become lucid** when you realize, “Yes, I AM dreaming!”

---

### 🌌 **3. Set Strong Intention Before Sleep**

Your subconscious listens closely before sleep.

Say mentally or out loud:

> _“Tonight I will realize I’m dreaming.”_

Also visualize yourself _becoming lucid_ in a dream. Feel the excitement and wonder.

---

### 🌙 **4. Use the MILD Technique (Mnemonic Induction)**

When you wake up from a dream in the middle of the night, do this:

- Recall the dream clearly.
    
- Say:
    
    > _“Next time I’m dreaming, I will remember I’m dreaming.”_
    
- Visualize yourself becoming lucid in that same dream.
    

Then go back to sleep with that intention. This taps deep into your subconscious.

---

### ⏰ **5. Wake Back to Bed (WBTB)**

This is one of the most powerful techniques.

**How to do it:**

- Set an alarm for 4–6 hours after falling asleep.
    
- Wake up, stay up for 15–30 minutes.
    
- Read about lucid dreaming, or meditate gently.
    
- Go back to bed with a strong lucid intention.
    

Your brain re-enters **REM sleep quickly**, and lucidity becomes much more likely.

---

## 🧘 Bonus: Meditate During the Day

Lucid dreaming is about _self-awareness._ The more aware you are **now**, the more likely you are to become aware **in dreams**.

Practice **being present**, just watching your thoughts, observing your body and sensations—this awareness spills into dream time.

---

## 🪞 What Happens When You Get Lucid?

Once you become lucid, don’t get _too excited_, or you might wake up!

👉 Rub your hands, touch the ground, spin in place—this **stabilizes** the dream.

Then... ask anything.  
Fly.  
Visit places.  
Ask your subconscious a question.  
Even look in a mirror and meet your inner self.

### 🕯️ **1. Prepare Your Space**

- Dim the lights.
    
- Set your dream journal next to your bed.
    
- Put your phone on airplane mode or silent.
    

✨ Optional: Light incense or use calming essential oils (lavender, sandalwood, etc.)

---

### 🧘 **2. Gentle Meditation (2–3 minutes)**

Sit or lie down, close your eyes, and take **deep breaths**:

> Inhale for 4 seconds,  
> Hold for 4,  
> Exhale for 6–8 seconds.  
> Repeat.

Let all thoughts fade. Just be.

---

### 🧠 **3. Lucid Affirmations (Say silently or out loud)**

Repeat with intention and feeling:

- _“I am aware in my dreams.”_
    
- _“I recognize when I am dreaming.”_
    
- _“Tonight, I will become lucid.”_
    
- _“I will remember my dreams clearly.”_
    
- _“My dreams are sacred space.”_
    

Let each affirmation sink in fully.

---

### 🌌 **4. Visualization (2 minutes)**

As you're lying in bed, gently imagine this:

You're in a dream, maybe walking through a surreal place—then suddenly, you **look at your hands**, or **see something strange**, and realize:

> _“Wait… I’m dreaming!”_

Imagine the joy and excitement of that moment. Let your body feel it.

This "pre-programs" your subconscious.

---

### 💤 **5. Sleep Gently**

As you drift off, let one last affirmation echo in your mind:

> _“I will wake up inside my dream.”_

Fall asleep peacefully. Let go. Trust the process.

---

## 🌀 Optional: MILD Booster (If You Wake Up in the Night)

If you naturally wake up during the night (or use Wake Back to Bed), gently recall your dream and say:

> _“Next time I’m dreaming, I will remember I’m dreaming.”_

Then go back to sleep with that intention.
