### 🌌 **1. Astral Projection (Out-of-Body Experience / OBE)**

**What it is:**  
A conscious experience of separating your awareness or “astral body” from your physical body. You often feel yourself _leaving the body_ and floating or traveling in other dimensions or realms—especially the _astral plane_.

**Key traits:**

- You _consciously_ leave your body (usually from a deep meditative or trance state).
    
- You are fully aware (like waking consciousness).
    
- The world you see may look like this world, or it may be an entirely different realm (astral, spiritual, or symbolic).
    
- Some people encounter guides, beings, or visit past lives, higher planes, or distant places.
    

**Feels like:**  
A floaty, vibrational, sometimes intense experience where your awareness feels like it’s no longer in your physical form.
