# **Why You Don’t Need Motivation***

Motivation is **temporary**—it fades quickly. What you truly need is **discipline** because:

- **Discipline = Infinity = Consistency**
    
- **Motivation = Temporary = Unreliable**
    

Motivation is like a small burst of pleasure—you only act when you **feel like it**. But when you don’t feel motivated, you start **searching for it**, wasting time instead of taking action.

### **Example: Instant Gratification & P*rn**

Let’s say you’re watching p*rn. Ask yourself:

- **Why are you watching this?**
    
- **Does it actually help you?**
    
- **What are the real benefits?**
    

You're watching it for **temporary pleasure**—just to **feel good for a moment**. But once it’s over, then what? **Does it bring lasting value to your life?**

This is exactly why **discipline is key**. It keeps you moving forward, even when you **don’t feel like it**.
