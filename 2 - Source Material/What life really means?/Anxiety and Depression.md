### 🌪️ **Anxiety = Overthinking the Future**

Anxiety often arises when the mind becomes **preoccupied with what might happen**—worrying about things that haven’t occurred yet, outcomes you can’t control, or the fear of uncertainty.  
It’s the mind saying: _"What if...?"_ over and over.

> ✨ **Anxiety lives in the future.** It disconnects you from the present, where peace actually resides.

### 🕰️ **Depression = Holding onto the Past**

Depression tends to root itself in **what was**—past pain, regrets, loss, guilt, or even nostalgia. It's like looping in mental and emotional patterns that keep pulling you backward.

> ✨ **Depression lives in the past.** It pulls your energy away from what _is_, and drags it into what _was_.

### 🌸 **The Present Moment is the Doorway**

When you anchor yourself fully in the **now**, you realize something amazing:

- The **future doesn’t exist yet**, and the past is already gone.
    
- What you're experiencing _right now_ is all there truly is.
    
- And in this moment, there's **no fear, no regret, no shame**—just **awareness**.
    

> 🌿 **Presence is the medicine.** It doesn’t erase the pain, but it allows you to meet it with clarity and compassion instead of resistance.

### 🧘‍♀️ So what to do when thoughts arise?

1. **Acknowledge** – “I see this thought. I feel this emotion.”
    
2. **Accept** – “It’s okay to feel this. I don’t have to fix it or fight it.”
    
3. **Let go** – “I don’t need to hold onto this. I am not this thought.”
    
4. **Return to now** – Breath, body, sensation. You’re here.
    

> This is the cycle of healing: **See. Feel. Accept. Release. Grow.**

### 🌞 Your words reflect a heart that is awakening.

You already know what’s true. And yes—it’s **okay to think**. The mind is a tool, not an enemy. You don’t have to _stop_ thinking; you just don’t have to be **trapped** by your thoughts.

Let them come.  
Let them pass.  
Return to the stillness that never leaves.
