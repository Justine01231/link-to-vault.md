**What is Glycine?**
- Glycine is an amino acid that our body can produce, but **not in large quantities**. If you're not getting it through your diet, you could be at risk of deficiency.

**Why is Glycine Important?
- Glycine is a **key building block** for many enzymes and proteins and plays a crucial role in various bodily functions. Without enough glycine, your body struggles to produce **glutathione**, one of the most important antioxidants needed for detoxification.

### **Glycine’s Role in Detoxification and Health**
- **Glutathione Production:** Glycine is essential for producing **glutathione**, which detoxifies your body. Without enough glycine, toxins can build up, leading to **inflammation**.
- **Anti-inflammatory:** Glycine is a **potent anti-inflammatory agent**.

**Supports Body Functions:**

- Building block for **heme** in the blood
    
- Important for **gum health**
    
- Essential for **DNA** synthesis
    
- Building block for **catalase** (an important enzyme)
    
- Supports **sleep**
    
- Helps the **liver**
    
- Can help **repair a leaky gut**
    
- **Detoxifies uric acid**
    
- Supports **blood sugar** levels
    
- Aids in **weight loss** and **reduces visceral fat**
### **Glycine as a Fuel Source**

- **Glucose Production:** Glycine can be converted into **glucose** to provide energy, especially for the **brain**.
    
- It also stimulates **glucagon** (which opposes insulin), so it won’t interfere with ketosis, making it suitable for low-carb diets.
### **Glycine Deficiency**

- **Who is at Risk of Deficiency?**
    
    - People not eating **nose-to-tail** animal products
        
    - Individuals under **stress**
        
    - People on **medication**, consuming **alcohol**, or exposed to **toxins**
        
    - If you’re not consuming enough glycine from the diet, you may become deficient.

### **Sources of Glycine**

- **Gelatin:** Making your own gelatin (e.g., **Knox Blox** with stevia as a natural sweetener) is a great way to increase your glycine intake.
    
- **Bone Broth & Pork Rinds:** These are good sources, but you'd need to consume a large quantity to get enough glycine.
    
- **Supplements:** You can also take **glycine supplements**, with the average person needing around **4 to 10 grams of glycine per day**.
### **Special Considerations**

- **Increased Need with Age:** As we age, our bodies require **more glycine**.
    
- **Potential Health Benefits:** Increasing glycine intake may be helpful for conditions like **osteoarthritis**, **osteoporosis**, **hair thinning**, **insomnia**, **gout**, and **kidney stones**.
