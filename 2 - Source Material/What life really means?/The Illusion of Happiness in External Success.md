**1. The Chase for Fulfillment**

People often believe they will be happy when they achieve something (e.g., a perfect body, fame, success, money).

Common thoughts:

- "I’ll be happy when I lose weight."
    
- "I’ll be happy when I get a promotion."
    
- "I’ll be happy when I find the right partner."
    

**The reality:** These external achievements don’t guarantee lasting happiness. Many people achieve their goal, feel happy for a moment, but then move on to the next goal, always feeling dissatisfied.

**2. The Personal Journey of Realization**

### Maggie’s Story

- Wanted to be famous since childhood.
    
- Acting gave her attention and validation, making her feel special.
    
- Deep down, the desire for fame came from feeling unworthy.
    
- She believed that fame would make her feel loved and complete.
    
- After years of auditions, small wins, and rejections, she realized:
    
    - "I am worthy right now, and so are you."
        
    - Fame wasn’t what she truly wanted—she was actually seeking love, validation, and acceptance.
        

### The Illusion of the Perfect Body

- Maggie believed she wouldn’t be loved unless she was thin.
    
- Every failed relationship made her think, “I wasn’t thin or pretty enough.”
    
- She became obsessed with her weight, controlling her entire life.
    
- Eventually, she lost weight and found love, entering a dream relationship.
    
- However, even with love, her obsession with weight remained.
    

**The realization:**

- What she truly wanted wasn’t a perfect body or relationship.
    
- What she actually needed was self-acceptance and self-love.
    
- "I need to love myself, approve of myself, and accept myself no matter what I weigh or look like."
    
- "I could have given myself that love a long time ago."

**3. Lessons from the Elderly**

### Perspectives from Working with Aging Patients

Maggie has been a podiatrist for 20 years, working with patients over 70, 80, 90, and even 100 years old.

**Observations:**

- Money doesn’t guarantee happiness: Some wealthy patients still feel empty, while others give away their money without caring for themselves.
    
- Many elderly people still chase external validation, even into their 90s:
    
    - Some worry about wrinkles.
        
    - Others compare themselves to younger people.
        
    - One 92-year-old patient envied her 70-year-old daughter-in-law’s skin.
        
- Happiness comes from mindset, not circumstances.
    

### The Difference Between Those Who Age Well vs. Those Who Don't

Some patients are curious, joyful, and full of life:

- They keep learning, growing, and trying new things (e.g., an 85-year-old skydiving).
    
- They focus on experiences and purpose, not appearance.
    

Others become bitter, small-minded, and obsessed with the past.

**Lesson:**

- "We are either evolving or devolving—there is no staying the same."
    
- If you’re not learning and growing, you’re shrinking.

**4. What True Freedom and Confidence Look Like**

True freedom is when the things that used to scare you don’t scare you anymore.

**Signs of real confidence:**

- Speaking in front of people without anxiety.
    
- Not being affected by mean or cruel people.
    
- Not caring what others think about you.
    
- Letting go of past wounds and triggers.
    
- Looking in the mirror and loving your aging face and body.
    
- Walking into a party and thinking, “Who can I meet? What can I learn?” rather than worrying about appearances.

**The Illusion of Social Media and External Validation**

- Seeking validation through social media, likes, and comments is a trap.
    
- Many people post pictures online to create an illusion of happiness and success.
    
- True confidence is when external things no longer have power over you.
    
- You stop walking around offended, taking things personally, or being triggered by people.
    
- No one has that power over you unless you let them.

**Overcoming Scarcity and Fear**

Maggie once believed she wouldn’t feel safe until she paid off her mortgage (which would take 25 years).

**A realization changed her mindset:**

- Even if the mortgage was gone, there would always be bills, responsibilities, and uncertainties.
    
- Her real fear was scarcity and a lack of security.
    
- Instead of waiting for external security, she chose to cultivate a feeling of safety within herself.
    

### The Universe is Benevolent:

- She once believed the world was harsh and unforgiving.
    
- Now, she sees that life always works out—even if it doesn’t look the way we expect.
    
- Reframing the negative into the positive changes everything.
    
- As Einstein said (paraphrased):
    
    - "You must decide if the universe is friendly or not."
        
- Once she chose to believe in a friendly universe, everything shifted.

**Letting Go of the Fear of Success and Failure**

Maggie runs a YouTube channel, which she deeply loves. A recent video went viral (33,000+ views), and she felt thrilled.

But then… fear crept in:

- What if the next video flops?
    
- What if it was just a one-time success?
    
- What if I can’t replicate it?
    

She had lost sight of the real reason she started:

- The goal isn’t to go viral—it’s to serve, grow, and share value.
    
- Success isn’t in the numbers; it’s in making a difference.
    
- Everyone has something to offer.

**The Journey is the Destination**

- Many people say, "It’s not the journey, it’s the destination."
    
- But a wise teacher once told her: "The journey is the destination."
    

**The joy isn’t in reaching the goal—it’s in the process of getting there.**

- It’s all the little wins, victories, and struggles along the way.
    
- It’s the hero’s journey—the obstacles, the challenges, the dragons to slay.
    
- Every step, every challenge is part of the adventure.
    
- There will always be another mountain to climb, another lesson to learn.
    
- And that’s the beauty of life itself.
    

Instead of waiting for happiness in some distant future, we can choose to feel worthy, safe, and loved right now. True fulfillment comes from within, not from external achievements.
