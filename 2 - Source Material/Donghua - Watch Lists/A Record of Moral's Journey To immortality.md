**Synopsis**  
_Han Li_, an ordinary boy from a poor village, is recruited into a small sect with hopes of achieving immortality. Unlike most xianxia protagonists with divine talents or legendary bloodlines, Han Li is simply **a mortal** with intelligence, patience, and a strong will.

Through a series of **coincidences, perseverance, and clever strategies**, he slowly climbs the ranks in the world of cultivation, encountering **powerful sects, ancient secrets, and deadly betrayals**. With a mysterious bottle that accelerates the growth of medicinal herbs and his ever-evolving techniques, he navigates through **countless dangers** on his quest to ascend beyond mortality.

Unlike many other xianxia stories where protagonists quickly gain godlike power, Han Li's journey is **slow, methodical, and realistic**, making this one of the most **detailed and immersive cultivation stories** ever written.
