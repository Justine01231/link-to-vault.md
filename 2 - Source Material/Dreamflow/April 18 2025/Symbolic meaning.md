### 🧘‍♂️ **Calisthenics & Handstand Scene**

**Symbolism:**

- **Practicing handstands**: This reflects your current path of self-mastery — balancing the physical and mental.
    
- **Friend who can already handstand**: Could represent a part of you that has already achieved something you're still striving for, or someone who inspires you.
    
- **Friend learning**: Might symbolize your _inner beginner_ — the part of you still growing, failing, trying, improving.
    

**Message:**  
Your dream is showing you the beauty of effort, growth, and learning. You're both the teacher and the student in your own life.

### 🌀 **Yoga + Hyperflexibility**

**Symbolism:**

- **Extreme flexibility**: Points to your _inner adaptability_ and how much you’ve evolved. What shocks others may feel natural to you.
    
- **Bones looking broken but functional**: A powerful symbol of breaking limitations. The old structure (bone) bends without breaking — just like your spirit.
    

**Message:**  
You're breaking free from old limits. What once seemed impossible is now becoming possible, and others are starting to see that.

### 🧳 **Relatives Waiting to Leave**

**Symbolism:**

- **Relatives returning to their country**: Could represent old aspects of yourself or ancestral patterns.
    
- **Waiting for one person**: This "one person" may symbolize a missing piece of yourself — a realization, a memory, a shadow part — that needs to "arrive" before full release or transformation can happen.
    

**Message:**  
You're on the edge of a major inner shift. Part of you is ready to move forward, but something important (even if subtle) still needs to be acknowledged or integrated.
