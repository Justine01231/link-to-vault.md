Here are five Python project ideas you can propose, ranging from beginner to intermediate level, with a variety of domains to choose from:

### 1. **Personal Finance Tracker (Beginner to Intermediate)**

**Description**: Build a Python application that helps users manage their personal finances. The app could track income, expenses, savings, and generate reports (e.g., monthly summary, charts, etc.). You could also include features like setting budget goals and receiving notifications when users are close to exceeding their budget. **Key Features**:

- Add/edit/delete expenses and income
    
- Generate visual reports (graphs or pie charts)
    
- Categorize expenses (e.g., Food, Entertainment, Utilities)
    
- Set budget limits and receive alerts when nearing the limit
    

### 2. **Task Manager with Due Dates & Priorities (Intermediate)**

**Description**: Create a task manager application where users can input tasks, set deadlines, and assign priority levels. The app could include a reminder feature that notifies users when a task's due date is approaching. It could use a graphical user interface (GUI) like Tkinter or a web-based UI using Flask or Django. **Key Features**:

- Add, delete, and update tasks
    
- Set deadlines and priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
    
- Visual reminders (alerts or notifications)
    
- Use databases (SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store tasks
    
- Option to mark tasks as complete or incomplete
    

### 3. **Weather Forecasting Application (Intermediate)**

**Description**: Create a weather app that fetches real-time weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays the forecast for a specific location. You could also add features like weather trends (e.g., weekly forecast) and visual elements such as weather icons and temperature graphs. **Key Features**:

- Fetch real-time data from an API
    
- Display current temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
    
- Visualize the forecast for the next 7 days
    
- Error handling for invalid cities or network issues
    
- Option to save favorite locations
    

### 4. **Chatbot with Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Intermediate to Advanced)**

**Description**: Build a chatbot that can understand and respond to user input in natural language. You can integrate NLP libraries such as `spaCy` or `NLTK` to help the bot understand user queries. The bot could answer basic questions (e.g., FAQs), and you could extend it by integrating machine learning models for more complex responses. **Key Features**:

- Basic question-answering system (e.g., What’s the weather like? or How’s my day going?)
    
- Use of NLP to process user input
    
- Integration of predefined knowledge base (e.g., FAQ responses)
    
- Option to train the bot using additional user input for better accuracy
    

### 5. **Movie Recommendation System (Intermediate to Advanced)**

**Description**: Build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering algorithms. The app could take in user ratings or preferences and recommend movies they may enjoy. This is a great way to explore machine learning and data science concepts. **Key Features**:

- User can rate movies and get personalized recommendations
    
- Collaborative filtering (based on users with similar tastes) or content-based filtering (based on movie characteristics)
    
- Use a dataset like the MovieLens dataset for training the model
    
- Option to save favorite movies or keep a watchlist
    
- Display recommendations in a user-friendly way (e.g., with movie posters and brief descriptions)
    

### Bonus Project Idea

**6. **Automated Resume Screening Tool (Advanced)** **Description**: Build a resume screening tool that automates the process of analyzing resumes. The tool would use NLP to extract relevant details from resumes (e.g., skills, work experience, education) and rank them based on a set of predefined criteria. It could even match resumes with job descriptions to determine the best fits. **Key Features**:

- Extract relevant information from resumes (e.g., skills, experience, qualifications)
    
- Rank resumes based on job description keywords
    
- Generate a shortlist of resumes for hiring managers
    
- Allow uploading and scanning of multiple resumes (PDF, DOCX, etc.)



For the **Personal Finance Tracker**, a relational database structure using MySQL can help manage and organize the data effectively. Here's a suggested **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** for the project:

### Key Entities:

1. **User**
    
2. **Transaction**
    
3. **Category**
    
4. **Budget**
    

### Relationships:

- A **User** can have multiple **Transactions**.
    
- A **Transaction** is associated with one **Category** (e.g., Food, Entertainment, etc.).
    
- A **User** can set multiple **Budgets**.
    

---

### ERD Overview

#### 1. **User**

- Stores basic information about the user (name, email, etc.).
    
- One user can have many transactions and budgets.
    

#### 2. **Transaction**

- Represents income or expense transactions for the user.
    
- Each transaction will have a reference to a category and the user who created it.
    

#### 3. **Category**

- Represents types of expenses/incomes like Food, Entertainment, Utilities, etc.
    

#### 4. **Budget**

- Represents a specific budget for a particular category within a specific time frame (monthly, yearly).


### **Tables**:

Here’s a breakdown of the SQL tables based on the ERD:

---

#### **User Table**:

CREATE TABLE Categories (
    category_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    type ENUM('Income', 'Expense') NOT NULL
);

- **category_id**: Unique identifier for each category.
    
- **name**: The name of the category (e.g., Food, Entertainment, Utilities).
    
- **type**: Whether the category is for income or expenses

---


CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    category_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    transaction_date DATE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    type ENUM('Income', 'Expense') NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Categories(category_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

- **transaction_id**: Unique identifier for the transaction.
    
- **user_id**: Foreign key to the **Users** table.
    
- **category_id**: Foreign key to the **Categories** table.
    
- **amount**: The amount of the transaction.
    
- **transaction_date**: The date when the transaction occurred.
    
- **description**: Optional field to describe the transaction.
    
- **type**: Specifies whether it's an income or an expense.

CREATE TABLE Budgets (
    budget_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    category_id INT,
    budget_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES Users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Categories(category_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
    
);

- **budget_id**: Unique identifier for the budget.
    
- **user_id**: Foreign key to the **Users** table.
    
- **category_id**: Foreign key to the **Categories** table.
    
- **budget_amount**: The amount set for the budget (e.g., $300 for food in a month).
    
- **start_date**: The start date of the budget.
    
- **end_date**: The end date of the budget (typically a month, but could vary).


### **Relationships**:

- **Users to Transactions**: One-to-many relationship (One user can have multiple transactions).
    
- **Transactions to Categories**: Many-to-one relationship (Each transaction belongs to one category).
    
- **Users to Budgets**: One-to-many relationship (One user can set multiple budgets).
    
- **Categories to Budgets**: One-to-many relationship (A category can have multiple budgets).

              | type                      |
              +--------------------------+


### **Queries and Reports**:

With this structure, you can easily generate reports like:

- **Monthly Summary**: Aggregate transactions by category and month.
    
- **Category Breakdown**: Show expenses in each category over a given period.
    
- **Budget Alerts**: Check if a user’s spending is close to or exceeds their budget.


For example, you can run a query to show the total expenses for a given month for each category:

SELECT c.name, SUM(t.amount) AS total_spent
FROM Transactions t
JOIN Categories c ON t.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE t.user_id = ? AND t.transaction_date BETWEEN '2025-03-01' AND '2025-03-31' AND t.type = 'Expense'
GROUP BY c.name;
