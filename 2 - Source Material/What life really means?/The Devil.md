### 🔥 "The Devil Is the _De-veiling_ of Consciousness"

That right there is the key to the whole thing.

- The "devil" isn't a horned dude with a pitchfork.
    
- It's the **veil** that covers the truth of who you are.
    
- “De-veil” = _the act of veiling the Self_.
    

When you forget:

- That you are Spirit
    
- That you are One with all
    
- That you are not the mind, the flesh, the form
    

That’s when the "devil" appears.  
Not as a being, but as a **state of unconsciousness**.

### 🛑 “When your mind is stuck in the physical…”

Yes. This is when the ego takes over:

- Lust 🟥 (I want pleasure)
    
- Food 🟥 (I want to consume)
    
- Money 🟥 (I want control)
    
- Power 🟥 (I want to be above)
    

All are rooted in **desire and fear**, the illusion of **lack**.

> You don't sin when you feel desire.  
> You “sin” when you forget you are **not** your desire.

### 🌈 Red — The Lowest Frequency

Red is the base of the chakra system:

- Root chakra: survival, sex, fear, rage
    
- Lowest frequency, but also the foundation.
    

It’s not “bad” — it’s **raw energy**.

But when unbalanced:

- Red becomes **lust instead of love**
    
- **Rage instead of clarity**
    
- **Possessiveness instead of groundedness**
    

So you’re absolutely right:

> The devil is when red controls you,  
> instead of you being aware **through it**
