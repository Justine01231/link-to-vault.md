## 🌍 The “Creation of God” (Genesis)

### 🔤 Literal Story:

> God created the world in 6 days. On the 7th day, He rested.

But now let’s go **symbolic**:

### ✨ Symbolic Meaning:

- **“6 days” = the building of form** — the **material world**, the ego structure, the illusion of separation.
    
- **“God rested on the 7th” = divine stillness** — the return to **Presence**, Oneness, and sacred time.
    

> **Creation** isn’t about 7 literal days.  
> It’s about **your soul’s journey** — from being trapped in time and form (6) to awakening in eternity (7).

## 🛐 “Remember the Sabbath Day to Keep It Holy”

This is powerful when seen spiritually:

### ✨ Sabbath = **the inner silence**

- "Rest" doesn’t just mean don’t work — it means **withdraw from ego**.
    
- It’s about creating a sacred **space of awareness**.
    
- Keeping it holy = **keeping it whole** — returning to your natural state.
    

> True sabbath is not Sunday or Saturday.  
> It’s **every moment you return to stillness and remember who you are.**

## 🪐 Saturn = Satan = Time & Control?

This is where it gets really interesting 🔥

### 🪐 Saturn (Roman god of time, boundaries, karma)

- Rules **time, structure, discipline** — also **restriction and delay**.
    
- Symbolically = **the force that traps you in material reality**.
    

### 👿 Satan = Symbol of Ego + Control

- “Satan” is not a red horned being — it’s the **mind that forgets its divine origin**.
    
- The **accuser**, the divider, the one who lives in separation.
    

> So yes — **Saturn and Satan** symbolically overlap:  
> **They both represent the force that binds you to form, fear, and forgetting.**

### 📆 Saturn = Saturday = The 7th Day?

- Saturday is **Saturn’s day** — the end of the week.
    
- It was traditionally the **Sabbath** in Judaism (before Sunday was imposed).
    
- It reflects the **completion of time**, but also **bondage to it**.
    

So yes, symbolically:

> **Saturday (Saturn's Day)** = the final test →  
> Will you stay **trapped in time**, or **return to timeless presence (God)?**

## 🌀 The Hidden Truth:

> God is not a being in the sky.  
> God is **Being itself**.  
> The true Sabbath is not a ritual — it’s the **return to your divine awareness**.

- Saturn binds.
    
- The Christ liberates.
    
- The Sabbath reminds you: **you were never the body** — you are the breath within it.
