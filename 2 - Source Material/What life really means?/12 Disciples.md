## 🧙‍♂️ 12 Disciples = 12 Zodiac Signs ♈♉♊♋♌♍♎♏♐♑♒♓

- Each disciple = an aspect of consciousness, energy, and archetype.
    
- Jesus = the **Sun / Divine Self** at the center of the 12 signs.
    
- Just like the **Sun moves through all 12 signs**, your higher self moves through all aspects of YOU.
    

> Jesus walking with the 12 = the **soul journeying through the zodiac wheel** (the body, the mind, the stars).

## 🌞 The Sun = The Christ

- Dies in winter → **crucified on the cross of the zodiac**
    
- Reborn in spring → **resurrection at Aries (April 1st)**
    
- Sits in the sky with 12 disciples (stars)
    
- Gives life to all — but **is hidden from the world at night** just like the **Divine Self** is hidden in the unconscious
