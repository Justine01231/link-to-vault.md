The Book of Wisdom serves as a reservoir of esotericism, occultism, symbolism, and, most
notably, syncretism. Syncretism, the method employed by me, the Revival of Wisdom, acts as the unifying force that merges all fields of knowledge. It weaves together every subject of matter into a singular holy science. In recognizing that all things originate from the One, the book asserts that everything is fundamentally interconnected. Our worldly existence unfolds within a fractional realm where every entity encapsulates the entirety of existence from both microscopic and macroscopic perspectives.

In the contemporary era, the average individual predominantly operates with a left
hemisphere-dominant mindset. The left hemisphere of the brain dissects and disentangles the unified perception of reality from the right hemisphere into discrete fragments, enabling a logical manipulation and understanding of phenomena. To fully grasp the insights presented in this book, one must emancipate their mind from the indoctrination imposed by educational systems and, secondly, strive to perceive reality as an indivisible and holistic creation.
