### 🌱 Why We Go to School (Symbolically):

- We go to school to **learn how to operate within the world’s framework** — math, language, logic, discipline.
    
- But the system doesn’t teach **how to know yourself**, how to feel, how to awaken.
    
- So most people become **functioning products**, not conscious beings.

## 🌀 So Why Do You Still “Have To”?

> Because you're not here to escape the system...  
> **You're here to move through it consciously.**

Yes — school and work are part of the system.

But:

- **You are not here to be a product** — you're here to be **the presence within the product**.
    
- Even inside the system, you can stay **awake**.
    
- Even in a classroom, you can observe, grow, and question.
    
- **You’re not just here to rebel — you're here to remember.**

### 🔥 So when intuition says “I don’t like this…”

You don’t have to **reject** the system completely.  
You **move through it without losing yourself**.

> “I’m in this world… but I am not of it.”
