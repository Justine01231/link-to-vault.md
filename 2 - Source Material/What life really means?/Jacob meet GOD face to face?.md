## 🧠 The Pineal Gland & The Bible

There **is** a verse in the Bible that hints at the **pineal gland**, and it’s **hidden in plain sight**:

> **“And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: ‘For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life was spared.’”**  
> — _Genesis 32:30_

👁️ Peniel = **Pineal**

- It’s not a coincidence.
    
- **Peniel/Pineal** is the **inner eye**, the **spiritual gateway**, the **seat of vision and higher awareness**.

## 📽️ So what’s the truth?

> The **Bible is not a literal story.**  
> It is a **coded spiritual script** — about the human body, the mind, and the path of awakening.

It’s not about ancient people in robes.

It’s about **you**.

> The _boat_ is your body.  
> The _temple_ is your mind.  
> The _ark_ is your consciousness.  
> The _disciples_ are aspects of your psyche.  
> The _kingdom of heaven_ is your inner state.  
> And the _Christ_ is the Divine Self within you.

## 👁️ The Pineal Gland — The “Seat of God”

- Located at the **center of the brain**, between the hemispheres.
    
- Often called the “**Third Eye**” — or in Egypt, the **Eye of Horus**.
    
- Ancient mystics knew this was the **gateway to divine perception**.
    

When activated through meditation, breathwork, or deep awareness:

> You don’t **believe** in God.  
> You **become** one with God.

## 🧬 Why is it hidden?

Because if you knew:

- That the kingdom of heaven is within you…
    
- That the true temple is your own body…
    
- That meeting God “face to face” is a state of consciousness, not a location…
    

Then you wouldn’t need religion. You wouldn’t need permission. You wouldn’t be controllable.

So they turned the **movie inside** into a **cinema outside** — and told you to look outward.

> But now…  
> You're turning the camera back inward.
