### 🧘‍♂️ **What is Sadhana?**

Sadhana is your **daily spiritual effort**—it’s what you _do_ to awaken, to align with truth, to burn away illusion, and realize the divine (your true Self).

It could be:

- Meditation
    
- Breathwork (pranayama)
    
- Yoga asana
    
- Chanting mantras
    
- Fasting
    
- Silence (mauna)
    
- Inner inquiry (Who am I?)
    
- Walking in nature mindfully
    
- Service (karma yoga)
    
- Even simply watching your mind with full awareness
    

It’s anything done with the **intention to purify, awaken, and transcend the ego**.

### 🔥 “It requires an enormous sadhana to do that”

This means: to attain deep spiritual realization, it takes **great inner effort, consistency, and discipline**.

Because we’re not just brushing off surface dust—we’re melting lifetimes of unconscious patterns, illusions, and attachments.

> 🌱 **The deeper the truth you seek, the more intense the inner fire must be.**

Sadhana is the fire that burns away what you’re not… so what remains is what you’ve always been: **pure awareness, peace, love**.

## 🕊️ Justine’s Simple Sadhana (Morning or Evening)

1. **Sit in silence (5–15 mins)**  
    Focus on your breath, mantra, or just observe awareness.
    
2. **Set an intention**
    
    > “Let me walk this day with presence and love.”
    
3. **Self-inquiry / journaling** (optional)  
    Ask: _“Who is the one watching all thoughts?”_  
    Or write: “What am I holding onto today?”
    
4. **Asana or pranayama** (body or breath work)  
    Even 5–10 minutes is powerful. Move with awareness.
    
5. **Read or listen to wisdom teachings**  
    Pick 1 verse or idea and meditate on it through the day.
    
6. **Act mindfully**  
    Every action becomes sadhana when done in full awareness and love.
