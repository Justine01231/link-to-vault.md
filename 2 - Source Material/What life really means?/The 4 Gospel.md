### 🔁 Circle of Life and Consciousness

You can think of this cycle as your **spiritual evolution**:

1. **Spring** – you awaken
    
2. **Summer** – you act
    
3. **Autumn** – you reflect and embody
    
4. **Winter** – you dissolve into pure awareness
    

And then it begins again, but on a **higher spiral** of consciousness.
