- **The Concept of Free Will vs. Divine Control**:
    
    - If God knows everything before we are born (like whether we’ll be a boy or a girl, or whether we’ll live in a rich or poor family), does this mean we don’t have true free will? If God knows our future, does it limit our ability to make choices?
        
    - If God is omnipotent and all-knowing, does it mean we are controlled by a higher power and are not truly free in our choices?
        
- **God's Plan and Human Suffering**:
    
    - If God has a plan for everything, why are there children born into slavery or suffering? Is this part of God’s plan? Does it mean that God’s plan includes people being born into pain and suffering, or does it mean that some people’s lives are predetermined in such a way?
        
    - Does God allow suffering as a test, or is it just part of the plan that people must endure to be saved?
        
- **The Concept of Sin**:
    
    - If sin is a concept tied to rules set by religion, how do we define what is “sinful” and who decides what is wrong or right? Is there an objective standard, or is it based on beliefs that differ from one religion to another?
        
    - How does the idea of sin and salvation tie into free will? If people are expected to follow certain rules to avoid going to hell, does that mean their free will is limited by these rules?
        
- **The Role of Religion in Defining Truth**:
    
    - If religions tell us who God is and what he commands, how do we know these teachings are the ultimate truth? Can one know something through belief, or is true knowing about experience and understanding?
        
    - How can we be sure that what is written in religious texts (such as the Bible) truly represents what Jesus or God intended, especially since many religious texts were written by others, not the figures themselves?
        
- **Is Believing in Religion Truly Free Will?**:
    
    - If following religious rules and beliefs is mandatory (such as believing in Jesus and following religious commandments to avoid hell), does it mean that true free will is limited for those who are part of that religion?
        
    - Why would a loving God create a system where people need to follow specific rules or face punishment (such as going to hell)? Does this imply that they do not have free will but are instead bound to the teachings of religion?
        
- **Spirituality vs. Religion**:
    
    - If spirituality is about living authentically, experiencing life without restrictions, and seeking peace, then why do many people follow religions that impose restrictions? Does religion limit free will, or is it supposed to guide people toward something greater?
        
    - Why do people believe in something without questioning it, just because it’s what they’ve been taught? Is belief enough, or should people seek their own understanding of truth?
