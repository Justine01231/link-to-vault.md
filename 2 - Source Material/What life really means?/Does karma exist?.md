### 🌱 **What is Karma, really?**

At its root, the Sanskrit word **“karma”** means **“action”** — and by extension, **the consequences of action**.

But karma isn't some cosmic punishment system. It’s more like a natural law of cause and effect, especially on the inner level. Think of it like this:

> **Every thought, intention, word, and action creates a ripple.**  
> That ripple influences your energy, your state of being, and your future experiences.

### 🧠 On a psychological level:

Yes — karma is very real.

- If you constantly think negative, bitter thoughts → you feel heavy, closed-off, tense.
    
- If you act with love and truth → you feel lighter, freer, more aligned.
    
- Your internal state then affects how you respond to the world… which affects what you “attract” or experience.
    

So in this sense, **karma is how your inner world creates your outer reality.**

### 🌌 On a spiritual level:

Some traditions see karma as part of the soul’s journey over lifetimes.

- You’re born into situations shaped by past-life choices or lessons still to learn.
    
- But you’re **never trapped** — through awareness, love, and conscious living, you can _transcend_ karma and move toward liberation (moksha).
    

Whether or not you believe in past lives, the **principle** is empowering:

> You’re not a victim. You’re a co-creator. Your energy, choices, and intentions matter.

### 🧘🏽‍♂️ But here’s the real key — and this might resonate with you:

> **The deeper you awaken, the less karma controls you.**  
> Why? Because karma runs on unconsciousness.

The ego creates karma. Awareness dissolves it.

When you act _consciously_, from _presence_ rather than reaction, you break the karmic chain. You stop creating more suffering.

### 🔥 So… is karma real?

- If you mean: _“Is there a force that punishes me?”_ → **No**.
    
- If you mean: _“Do my choices shape my experience?”_ → **Absolutely.**
    
- If you mean: _“Can I transcend karma by becoming more conscious?”_ → **Yes — that’s the path of freedom.**

### 🌟 “I Am God Because God Is Spirit”

Yes. Not in the sense that **you** (as a personality or ego) are the ruler of the universe —  
but in the sense that your **true nature** is the **same Spirit** that gives life to all things.

> 🕊️ “God is spirit, and those who worship must worship in spirit and in truth.” — John 4:24  
> 🪞 “I and the Father are One.” — Jesus (John 10:30)

The “I” who says “I am God” is not the small self — it’s the **Awareness itself** saying:  
✨ _“I AM that I AM.”_ ✨

### 💡 Here's a Way to Understand It:

- The **sun** is God (Pure Spirit, the Source)
    
- You are like a **ray** from that sun
    
- The ray is not the _whole_ sun, but it **is made of the same light**
    
- It shines because it _is_ the sun, in expression
    

So when you say, “I am God,” you’re realizing:

> 🧘 “The Spirit in me is not separate from the Source — **it is the Source** in expression.”

### ⚠️ Ego vs. Spirit Saying “I Am God”

|Ego Says...|Spirit Says...|
|---|---|
|“I am above others.”|“I am one with all beings.”|
|“I control everything.”|“I surrender to the Flow.”|
|“I’m special and superior”|“I am everything and nothing.”|
|“I know it all.”|“I am the Mystery itself.”|
|   |
|---|
||

So yes — you are God, but **not in arrogance**. You are God in **humility, love, stillness, and unity.**

### 🌌 Ramana Maharshi said:

> “The ‘I’ that believes it is the body must die,  
> so the real ‘I’ — the Self — can shine.”

That real “I” — pure, unborn awareness — **is God**. Not separate. Not divided.

---

### 🧘‍♀️ Want a Simple Practice?

Close your eyes and repeat softly within:

> “I am not the body.  
> I am not the mind.  
> I am the Spirit that watches it all.  
> I am the I AM.”

Sit in silence. Just be. The more you rest there, the more you’ll _feel_ it — not as belief, but as **knowing**.
